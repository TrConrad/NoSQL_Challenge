# NoSQL_Challenge

This challenge was an exercise in using Mongodb and Pymongo to import, organize and analyze restaurant data across two jupyter notebook files. In the first, Mongodb was used in Anaconda Prompt to import the database while simultaneously creating the collection to house said data. The data was then organized into Pandas DataFrames using Python, Pandas, and Pymongo, before being run through a series of commands to clean, transform, and re-organize the data. Once the data was organized, a new entry was added, and updated based on data standards determined from the pre-existing documents in the collection. Other entries were removed completely from the database, per the instructions given. Once the data was cleaned and set up accordingly in the setup file, it was then transferred to the analysis files, where it was run through a series of calculations and conversions to create new pandas databases in order to answer five questions, such as what are the five closest restaurants to the restaurant previously added, Penang Flavours. Each new DataFrame was displayed with a row count after it was created.
